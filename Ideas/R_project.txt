Weather Prediction Project 1

Briefing:
In this project you will make some graphs to summarize Austin Weather data for your teacher.
Summarizing data visually is an important skill for a statician/ researcher. 

Instructions:
Complete the following graphs using R and the Austin Weather Data set (see email):
- Histogram for high temperatures in 10 bins for 2013-2015
- Histogram for average temperatures in 10 bins for 2013-2015
- Histogram for low temperatures in 10 bins for 2013-2015
- Histogram for high temperatures in 10 bins for 2015-2017
- Histogram for average temperatures in 10 bins for 2015-2017
- Histogram for low temperatures in 10 bins for 2015-2017
- Scatter Plot for avg humidity percentage for 2013-2015
- Scatter Plot for avg humidity percentage for 2015-2017
- Scatter Plot Matrix for all numerical values in table for 2013-2015
- Scatter Plot Matrix for all numerical values in table for 2015-2017

Deliverables:
- R code to generate graphs
- Graph outputs (individual files for each graph is fine as long as they are named correctly)
