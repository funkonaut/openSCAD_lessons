# openSCAD_lessons
OpenSCAD based intro to coding curriculum for visually impaired and blind students. By Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired.

## Important Notes
**Its helpful to have the following materials and tools, you will need to access to a 3D printer**
- braille or bluetooth callipers
- braille/large print ruler
- speaking tape measure in mm
- 3D printer and raspberry pi for wireless printing
- APH graph board
- Playdoh
- On the fly tactile graphics tools
  - APH tactile drawing board or draftsmen 
  - Wicki stix
  - Embossing wheel

**Class notes/sequence**
*If you are a teacher clone this repo, if you are a student taking this class, congrats, you found the solutions, but remember you are only cheating yourself if you do not attempt problems independently, and there are not posted project solutions...*. This repo has all of the information (lessons, models, assignments) you need to teach the course. You can find code for students in the [lessons](./lessons) folder, here you will also find a teacher lesson (does not have "_student" suffix) that will have all the important information to lecture about during class and practice problem solutions. This should go without saying... but... *Do the lesson and practice problems yourself before teaching it." There is also a subfolder named "materials" which has a suggested sequence and over view of each sub lesson in a markdown document. Lessons are roughly one month in length, depending on the level of your students. A double block (1hr and 15m) class time is suggested. Teacher should have students mirror the folder and file structure of this github repo to help organize their work on their local computer. Cloud based storage such as google drive or drop box can be used but it is suggested that the files are accessible locally (either through drive for desktop or dropbox for desktop) as students will be running openSCAD locally. A class room entry routine could be:
1. Teachers send email with attached lesson code or instructions night before or day of class 
2. Students come into class on time and login to computer, open email and complete directions, downloading any attachments and placing them in the correct folder(s).

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

## Course Description
TSBVI's Fundamentals of Computer Science course explores the building blocks of computer science and the engineering design process through the introduction of digital fabrication tools and the OpenSCAD programming language (based upon the C programming language). Throughout the course students will complete several independent and group "design challenges" where they will use their knowledge to design and implement solutions to real world problems posed by TSBVI staff. After each "design challenge" students will present technical documentation to stakeholders for review. Once a month students will lead a question and answer session with a STEM industry professionals.

## Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course students will be able to:
- Understand and implement fundamental computer science concepts such as variables, basic boolean logic, basic control structures, and basic data structures
- Measure objects precisely to prepare technical descriptions 
- Use the engineering design process for problem solving 
- Maintain technical documentation and develop technical presentations
- Understand and implement the possibilities of digital fabrication in approaching and solving problems they may face in their everyday lives
- Use advanced prototyping and manufacturing techniques in the production of objects
 

## Grading
Grading is a combination of two areas:
- Class participation and attendance 50%
- Projects 50%
