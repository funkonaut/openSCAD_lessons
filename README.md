## Course Description
TSBVI's Fundamentals of Computer Science course explores the building blocks of computer science and the engineering design process through the introduction of digital fabrication tools and the OpenSCAD programming language (based upon the C programming language). Throughout the course students will complete several independent and group "design challenges" where they will use their knowledge to design and implement solutions to real world problems posed by TSBVI staff. After each "design challenge" students will present technical documentation to stakeholders for review. Once a month students will lead a question and answer session with a STEM industry professionals.

## Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course students will be able to:
- Understand and implement fundamental computer science concepts such as variables, boolean logic, control structures, and basic data structures
- Measure objects precisely to prepare technical descriptions 
- Use the engineering design process for problem solving 
- Maintain technical documentation and develop technical presentations
- Understand and implement the possibilities of digital fabrication in approaching and solving problems they may face in their everyday lives
- Use advanced prototyping and manufacturing techniques in the production of objects.

## Grading
Grading is a combination of two areas:
- Class participation and attendance 33%
- Projects 67%
