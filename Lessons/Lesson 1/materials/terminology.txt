Shape - Any graphical 2D or 3D object created by OpenSCAD.
Design - An OpenSCAD creation (that is, an OpenSCAD program), which usually consists of a combination of multiple shapes.
Operation - An OpenSCAD command that changes the appearance/properties of one or more shapes.
Parameter - Any value that specifies characteristics of shapes, operations, modules, or functions.
Preview - The process of quickly displaying a design on-screen.
Render - The process of fully evaluating the geometry of a design (and showing it on-screen). Once it’s rendered, you can export a design.
Units - All dimensions in OpenSCAD are specified in units. A unit is usually a millimeter (by 3D-printing industry convention), but OpenSCAD is technically unitless. All models should be explicitly sized in 3D-printing preparation software just prior to printing.
Width - The dimension associated with the x-axis, which is the “leftright” axis when 3D printing.
Length - The dimension associated with the y-axis, which is the “forward-backward” axis when 3D printing.
Height - The dimension associated with the z-axis, which is the “updown” axis when 3D printing.
2D shapes - Shapes with a width and length, but no height.
3D shapes - Shapes with a width, length, and height
Comment - A piece of code that does not execute it is preceded with // or for a multiline comment any text between /* and */
