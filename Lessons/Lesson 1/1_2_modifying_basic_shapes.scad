/*
Center
The sphere command draws a sphere so that itâ€™s centered around 
the origin; the cube, cylinder (and import) do not.abs

The  center will be at (0, 0, 0). Can not import centered shapes.

/*
Translate
Moves a shape to a specific location in the Preview window.

The below statement draws a cuboid that is shifted from its default position by 10 units in the negative direction along the x-axis, 20 units in the positive direction along the y-axis, and 0 units along the z-axis.

Cylinder and sphere move with respect to center of shape, cube moves relative to corner in orgin.

/*
Roundness
$fn specifies number of faces for a shape. $fn=50 is sufficiently smooth usually. $fn goes up render time goes up. Can be a parameter or its own statement where it will apply to everything before and after!

Student Lesson
Review quadrants in 3d space.
Solutions below:
*/
//Make a cube!

//Move it to the first octant.

//Make a cylinder!

//Move it to the first octant.

//Make a cone!


//Practice 
//Make a mickey mouse shape
