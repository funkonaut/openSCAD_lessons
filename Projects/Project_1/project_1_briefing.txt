Briefing:
I need tactile markers for the floor in the production studio so that students and staff can move the desks and place them back where it is necessary. We will be using what we learn in lessons 1-0 to create a better prototype for my tactile markers. Along the way you will also learn how to better use the 3D printer and practice measuring objects using calipers. This project will be based laregly upon the work you did in project 0. Future projects will follow a similar structure. 

Constraints: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in openSCAD
- Your prototype must use the velcro command strip (you all will get three, two to prototype with and one for your final product)
- Your prototype and project are due in two weeks

Functional Requirements:
- Marker is discernable to BVI students and staff
- Fits the width of a velcro command strip
- Marker does not impede travel of people or furniture
- Marker does not break if a desk rolls over it
- Marker is reusable and can be easily re-placed

Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- Technical documentation including sections on: ideas, measurements, object notes, construction notes, assembly/installation/use notes, and reflections along with atleast one photo of your final prototye
- 3D printed prototype
- .scad code file for your object

Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric.
