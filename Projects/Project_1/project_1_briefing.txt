Briefing:
I need tactile markers for the floor in the production studio so that students and staff can move furniture and place it back where it is necessary. We will be using what we learn in lessons 1-0 to create a better prototype for my tactile markers. Along the way you will also learn how to use the 3D printer and practice measuring objects using calipers. This project will be based laregly upon the work you did in project 0. Future projects will follow a similar structure. 

Constraints:
- Your prototype has to be designed in openSCAD
- Your prototype has to be 3D printable
- Your prototype and project are due by the end of next week: 9/2/2022

Functional Requirements:
- Marker is discernable to BVI students and staff
- Fits the width of a velcro command strip
- Marker does not impede travel of people or furniture
- Marker does not break if furniture rolls over it

Deliverables:
- Technical documentation, this will be modeled after the project_0_student file
- 3D printed prototype
- .scad code file that describes your object

Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric.
