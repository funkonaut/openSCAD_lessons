# Project 1.2: Real-Life Problem Solving with 3D Printing
<br><br>

## Briefing:
3D modeling and 3D printing can be used to solve tangible, everyday problems. For this project, you are tasked to identify a real-life problem encountered by you or someone you know that can be solved with a 3D printed object. Using a 3D model from an online repository, like [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com/) or [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model), you will solve this problem and become familiar with the engineering design process.
<br><br>

## Constraints: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece.
- You must utilize a 3D model from an online repository and adapt it for your purpose.
<br><br>

## Functional Requirements:
- Your prototype should solve the problem you've identified effectively and safely.
<br><br>

## Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- Technical documentation, including sections on: identified problem, solution concept, design ideas, measurements, object notes, construction notes, assembly/installation/use notes, and reflections along with at least one photo of your final prototype.
- 3D printed prototype.
- 3D model file (.stl or .obj) of your prototype
<br><br>

## Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale. Grading will be based on how well your prototype meets the identified problem, the effectiveness of the solution, the complexity and originality of the design, and the quality of your documentation.
