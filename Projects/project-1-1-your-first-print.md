# Project 1.1: My First 3D Print
<br><br>

## Briefing:
Welcome to your first hands-on project in 3D printing! In this project, you'll be using the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer and a model of your choice from an online repository. You'll learn about the process of downloading, setting up, and finally printing a 3D model. This project will help you understand the basics of 3D printing technology, and give you the confidence to progress to more complex prints in the future.
<br><br>

## Online Repository:
Below is a list of webpages you can use to download 3D model files:
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/)


## Constraints: 
- For this project, choose a relatively simple model from the online repository. You're just getting started, so we don't want to dive into the deep end too quickly. The model should not exceed a printing time of 2 hours.
- As you gain confidence with the 3D printer, we will move onto designing your own models in openSCAD, but for now, focus on understanding the printing process.
- Your printed model is due in 2 weeks.
<br><br>

## Functional Requirements:
- The 3D model must be downloaded from an online repository.
- The 3D print should be done using the Prusa Mini+ printer.
- The print settings should be correctly configured for the chosen model.
- The model should be printed without any significant printing errors.
<br><br>

## Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- A technical document detailing your experience with this project. Include sections on: ideas, measurements (dimensions of the model, amount of filament used, etc.), object notes (what the object is, where you found it, why you chose it), construction notes (any assembly needed post-printing), use notes (what is the printed object used for), and reflections on your first 3D printing experience. Also, include at least one photo of your final prototype.
- Your 3D printed prototype.
- Though not mandatory for this project, if you feel adventurous, you can try tweaking your model in openSCAD and provide the '.scad' code file for your object.

## Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric. Emphasis will be placed on correct use of the 3D printer, successful completion of the print, and the detail and reflection demonstrated in your technical documentation.
