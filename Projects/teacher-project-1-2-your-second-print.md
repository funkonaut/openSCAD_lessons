# Project 1.2: Real-Life Problem Solving with 3D Printing
<br><br>

## Briefing:
For this project, students will be identifying a real-life problem encountered by them or someone they know. They will then design and create a prototype using someone elses design and 3D printing to solve this problem. Students must  incorporate 3D models from online repositories like [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com/) or [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model).
<br><br>

## Modifications: 
- Students can browse models to determine problems to solve
- Students can work with external stake holders to solve problems for others
- Students can be given a specific problem to solve
<br><br>

## Teaching Tips:
- Encourage students to think outside the box, there's no problem too small or too big to tackle. This could be anything from a personalized pen holder to a tool to help a family member.
- The focus should be on problem-solving, creativity, and the application of 3D printing and slicing skills.
- Encourage students to iterate on their designs based on testing and feedback.
- Regularly check in with students to ensure they are making progress and to offer guidance or troubleshooting as necessary.
<br><br>

## Technical Tips:
- Remind students of the slicing commands covered in previous lessons. 
- Encourage students to make good use of the Thingiverse and Printables repositories to look for inspirations or components that they could use in their designs.
- Remind students of the print settings and capabilities of your specific 3D printer (print resolution, available colors, etc.)

## Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric. Grading will be based on how well each student's prototype meets the identified problem, the effectiveness of the solution, the complexity and originality of the design, and the quality of their documentation.
