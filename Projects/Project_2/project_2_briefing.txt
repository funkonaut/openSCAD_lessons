Briefing:
There are two design projects from external stake holders:
- A sock holder 
- A model rocket

Constraints: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in openSCAD
- You must have at least two iterations of prototypes
- Your prototype and project are due in two weeks

Functional Requirements:
- Determined by meeting with stake holder

Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- Technical documentation including:
  - Notes on functional requirements from stake holder meetings
  - Construction/ printing notes
  - Photos of the final prototype
  - Sign off by the stake holder on final prototype
- .scad code file for your object and .stl rendered file 

Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric.
