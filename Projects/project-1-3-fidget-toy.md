# Project X.X: Exploring Slicing Settings for Textured 3D Prints

## Briefing:
Welcome to Project X.X, where you will embark on an exciting journey to explore the world of 3D printing and slicing settings. Your task is to create a series of 3D printed prototypes, each demonstrating a unique texture or finish achieved through meticulous adjustment of slicing parameters using openSCAD and the Prusa Mini+ 3D printer with Prusa Slicer.

## Constraints:
- Your prototypes and documentation are due in [insert number] weeks.
- You must use flex filament 
- You must use at least 3 different filament materials'
- One of your prints must be on a medium such as sticky paper or fabric  

## Functional Requirements:
- Design and 3D print a series of at least six prototypes, each showcasing distinct textures or finishes.
- Experiment with different infill patterns, layer heights, and slicing settings for each prototype to achieve desired textures.
- Explore the use of multiple filament types, including standard and flexible filaments, to enhance texture variety.
- Utilize generative supports and or other advanced slicing techniques.
- Test and fine-tune slicing settings to ensure optimal print quality and texture fidelity.
- Experiment with printing on different mediums, such as sticky paper or standard paper, to enhance visual and tactile experiences.

## Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D prints):
- Comprehensive technical documentation encompassing initial ideas and concepts for each prototype.
- Precise measurements and specifications for each printed prototype.
- Detailed notes on design considerations and slicing settings adjustments for each texture.
- Construction notes detailing the 3D printing process, challenges faced, and problem-solving approaches.
- Assembly, installation, and usage instructions where relevant.
- Reflections on the design process for each prototype, highlighting successes and lessons learned.
- High-quality photos capturing the distinct textures and finishes of each prototype.
- The collection of 3D printed prototypes, showcasing the diversity of textures achieved.
- The respective .scad code file for each prototype's design.

## Rubric:
Evaluation will be conducted on a 0 to 9 point scale, focusing on:
- Alignment of each prototype with the problem of exploring slicing settings for textures.
- Effectiveness of each solution in achieving unique textures or finishes.
- Complexity, originality, and diversity of the design outcomes.
- Quality and detail of technical documentation for each prototype.
- Mastery of slicing settings demonstrated through diverse textures.
- Overall presentation, creativity, and innovation showcased in the prototypes.

Through Project X.X, you will not only deepen your understanding of 3D printing technology and design principles but also refine your ability to optimize slicing settings for specific texture goals.
