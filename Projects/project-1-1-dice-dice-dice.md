# Project 1.1: Dice Dice Dice
<br><br>

## Briefing:
Make three die. Bonus points if they are different in more than 3 ways.
<br><br>

## Constraints: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in openSCAD
- Each die must be unique
<br><br>

## Functional Requirements:
- Dice will not break when thrown
<br><br>

## Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- Technical documentation including sections on: ideas, measurements, object notes, construction notes, assembly/installation/use notes, and reflections along with atleast one photo of your final prototye
- 3D printed prototype
- .scad code file for your object
