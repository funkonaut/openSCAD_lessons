# Project 1.1: Dice Dice Dice
<br><br>

## Briefing:
Make three die. Bonus points if they are different in more than 3 ways.
<br><br>

## Constraints: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in openSCAD
- Each die must be unique
<br><br>

## Functional Requirements:
- Dice will not break when thrown
<br><br>

## Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- Technical documentation including sections on: ideas, measurements, object notes, construction notes, assembly/installation/use notes, and reflections along with atleast one photo of your final prototye
- 3D printed prototype
- .scad code file for your object
<br><br>

## Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale. Grading will be based on how well your prototype meets the identified problem, the effectiveness of the solution, the complexity and originality of the design, and the quality of your documentation.
