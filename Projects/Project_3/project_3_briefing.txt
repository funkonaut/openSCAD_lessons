Briefing:
In this project you will create a 3D printed beaded piece of jewelry

Constraints: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in OpenSCAD 
- Your deliverables are due end of week
- Code your project in one open SCAD file (all eight beads). We recommend printing your beads one at a time until you are happy with the shape.

Functional Requirements:
- Your OpenSCAD code must have two parametric modules for generating two different bead shapes
- You must use two different shaped beads in your design
- You must have at least 8 beads in your piece of jewelry
- Its not enough to just have beads you need to have a completed and wearable piece of jewelry 

Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print):
- Technical documentation, shared on google drive, including the following sections:
  - Design Notes (ideas, measurements, etc.)
  - Construction/ 3D Printing Notes
  - Photos of the final prototype
- .scad code file for your beads and .stl files 

Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric
