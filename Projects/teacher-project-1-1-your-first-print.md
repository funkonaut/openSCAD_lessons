# Your First 3D Printing Exploration
<br><br>

*Note Read* [*Chapter 5*](https://cdn.prusa3d.com/downloads/manual/prusa3d_manual_mini_en.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A121%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C0%2C297.272%2Cnull%5D) *of the Prusa Mini+ manual to help you complete this project if you have a Prusa Mini+ 3D printer.*

## Briefing:
In this project, you will explore the possibilities of 3D printing by selecting and printing a design from an online repository. The goal is to familiarize yourself with the process of 3D printing, from selecting a suitable design, preparing it for printing, to the actual printing process, and post-processing.
<br><br>

## Modifications: 
- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in openSCAD, this should be a modification of the original design or an additional part. OpenSCAD is a free software for creating solid 3D CAD objects, and will introduce you to a new method of designing for 3D printing.
- Your prototype and project are due in 4 weeks
<br><br>

## Teaching Tips:
- Encourage students to select designs that are within the capabilities of the printer, considering factors like print size, complexity, and the amount of filament required.
- Schedule a class to introduce openSCAD and guide students through the basics.
- Allocate time for students to discuss their chosen designs and their experiences with the printing process.
<br><br>

## Technical Tips:
- Remind students to check the printer's settings and make sure they are optimized for their specific design and material.
- Emphasize the importance of bed leveling and nozzle cleaning before starting the print.
- Encourage students to monitor their prints to ensure they are printing correctly.
<br><br>

## Rubric:
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric.
- 3 points: Successful print of the chosen design, demonstrating understanding of printer setup and operation.
- 3 points: Successful modification of the design in openSCAD, showing creativity and technical understanding.
- 3 points: Quality of the final prototype, including the quality of the print, post-processing, and assembly.
